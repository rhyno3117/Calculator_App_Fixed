## Calculator_App_Fixed

This is my second time making this calculator app and this one is better. 
I have fixed this one because I had a problem with my last calculator app and how my src folder dissapeared in it. 
This new, fixed calculator app now keeps all the numbers in the calculator. 
I have ran into another problem when publishing this application, all my code in src file and other components do not display in this repository on here in github. 
The link still works to my working calculator so I am not too worried but it still bothers me because this application is not built from just HTML.

Here is the link to the website to use this calculator!
